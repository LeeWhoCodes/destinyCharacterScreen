# Destiny Character Screen Recreation

A recreation of the character screen from the game Destiny, created using React and Tailwind. The reasons I chose to create this project were.
- To practice creating a page with a non-standard interface and layout.
- To practice creating interactions similar to the ones found in the game.

- How to create popovers using the popovers api
  - And how to position those popovers using the floating UI library
- Improved the speed at which I can take designs and recreate them into React components

# Future Improvements
